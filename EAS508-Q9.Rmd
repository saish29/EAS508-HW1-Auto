Question 9

This exercise involves the `Auto` data set available as `Auto.csv` available on the textbook website. Remove the missing values from the data.

```{r}
Auto <- read.csv("Auto.csv")
Auto <- na.omit(Auto)
summary(Auto)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
